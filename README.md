## How to Build and Run

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather a dataset of clean audio samples and separate noise recordings.

2. **Dataset Creation:**
   - Use `DatasetCreator.py` to map separate noises into clean audio samples, creating a dirty dataset.

3. **Spectrogram Creation:**
   - Use `SpectrogramsCreator.py` to create spectrograms of the input (noisy) and output (clean) audio samples.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Use `train.py` to train the autoencoder on the created spectrograms.

5. **Model Testing:**
   - Use `test.py` to predict on a file and evaluate the performance of the autoencoder.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow and Keras:** For building and training the autoencoder model.
- **Python:** For programming and real-time processing.
- **Signal Processing Libraries:** For data preprocessing and feature extraction.
- **Various Audio Libraries:** For handling audio data and formats.
